# File list and brew description: 
# MACHINE FILES:  
# FSMD: (the fsmd obviously), with rl FSMD.blif we start the machine; the first state on start S i/o = 1 and every gate at 0 (closed);
# start: (fsm) state code, kiss section. there you'll find the 5 state and outputs;
# starter: (Data path) here, throw gates bits input it will select the path for every register. every cycle every register is updated with opportune value. there are also implemented the errors
# counter (folder) there are the file used to store every gate with quantity check;
# machine the completed machine in a single file after simplify;
# operand (folder) the file the implements the operations;
# register (folder) the files to implement the registers prototype and constants;
# OTHER FILES:
# elaborato_VR421742_VR414014.circ file open with Logisim http://www.cburch.com/logisim/ ,basic draw implementation of the circuit, not completed to work
# sis-language.xml -> npp language defined for SIS https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ #~ALMOST_DONE
# flowChart.* are the files created with Microsoft Visio, thatâ€™s a map of var direction 
# 3d_machine.skb a draw of the machine with gates name and states #~TODO 

# to start the machine call ' rl FSMD.blif ' inside a sis environment.
