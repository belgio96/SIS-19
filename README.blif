# File list and brew description: 
# MACHINE FILES:  
# FSMD: (the fsmd obviously), with read_blif FSMD.blif we start the machine; the first state on start S i/o = 1 and every gate at 0 (closed);
# start: (fsm) state code, kiss section. there you'll find the 5 state and outputs;
# starter: (Datapath) here, throw gates bits input it will select the path for every register. every cycle every register is updated with opportune value. there are also implemented the errors
# backup folder is an old version of all, before the bug correction the second one before the simplification;
# counter folder there are the file used to store every gate with quantity chek;
# machine folder is not useful, just the state implementation by himself;
# operand folder the file the implements the operations;
# register folder the files to implement the registers prototype and costants;
# OTHER FILES:
# elaborato_VR421742_VR414014.circ file open with Logisim http://www.cburch.com/logisim/ ,basic draw implementation of the circuit, not completed not completed to work
# sis-language.xml -> npp language defined for SIS
# flowChart.* are the files created with Microsoft Visio, thatâ€™s a map of var direction ~TODO and maybe a state flowchart
# 3d_machine.skb ~TODO a draw of the machine with gates name and states

# to start the machine call ' read_blif FSMD.blif ' inside a sis eviroment.
